        // Array of 75 MCQs with detailed explanations
        const questions = [
            {
                question: "What does a Platform Solutions Analyst do at Goldman Sachs?",
                options: ["A) Managing customer relationships", "B) Developing new banking products", "C) Monitoring and investigating suspicious transactions", "D) Handling customer complaints"],
                answer: "C",
                explanation: "A Platform Solutions Analyst at Goldman Sachs acts as a 'traffic controller' for transaction systems, monitoring real-time alerts for suspicious activities, investigating potential fraud, escalating confirmed cases to Risk or Compliance teams, and improving fraud detection rules. Managing customer relationships, developing products, or handling complaints are not primary responsibilities of this role."
            },
            {
                question: "How would you set up real-time monitoring for card transactions?",
                options: ["A) Define risk rules", "B) Load data feeds", "C) Configure the engine", "D) All of the above"],
                answer: "D",
                explanation: "Setting up real-time monitoring involves defining risk rules (e.g., flagging transactions above ₹50,000), loading data feeds (e.g., cardholder profiles and merchant details), and configuring the engine to translate rules into logical conditions. All these steps are essential for effective monitoring."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the primary factor used to prioritize which alerts to review first?",
                options: ["A) The chronological order of the alerts", "B) The risk score of the alerts", "C) The merchant category code", "D) The customer's net worth"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "Alerts are prioritized based on their risk score, which combines factors like transaction amount, location, and customer context. A high score (e.g., 90/100) indicates immediate review, while lower scores can wait. Chronological order, MCC, or net worth are secondary considerations."
            },
            {
                question: "Which of the following is NOT a KPI for a Platform Solutions Analyst?",
                options: ["A) Alert volume vs. capacity", "B) Time-to-First-Review (TTFR)", "C) Number of transactions processed", "D) False-Positive Rate"],
                answer: "C",
                explanation: "KPIs for this role include alert volume vs. capacity, TTFR, False-Positive Rate, and Escalation Rate, as they measure efficiency and accuracy in fraud detection. The number of transactions processed is not a direct KPI, as it’s a system metric rather than an analyst performance indicator."
            },
            {
                question: "What is a false positive in fraud detection?",
                options: ["A) A fraudulent transaction that is not detected", "B) A legitimate transaction that is flagged as suspicious", "C) A transaction that is processed too slowly", "D) A transaction that exceeds the customer's credit limit"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "A false positive occurs when a legitimate transaction, like a valid airline ticket purchase, is flagged as suspicious due to high amount or travel-related MCC. This can annoy customers and waste analyst time, unlike undetected fraud (false negative) or other issues."
            },
            {
                question: "What is PCI-DSS and why is it important?",
                options: ["A) A standard for data security", "B) A type of fraud", "C) A banking product", "D) A risk scoring method"],
                answer: "A",
                explanation: "PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a set of rules ensuring card data security through encryption, access controls, and logging. It’s critical to protect customer data, avoid fines, and maintain Goldman Sachs’ reputation, unlike fraud types, products, or scoring methods."
            },
            {
                question: "What is an MCC in fraud detection?",
                options: ["A) Merchant Credit Code", "B) Merchant Category Code", "C) Master Card Code", "D) Monetary Control Code"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "A Merchant Category Code (MCC) is a 4-digit number classifying merchant types (e.g., 5411 for grocery stores). Analysts use MCCs to identify unusual transactions, such as an ATM withdrawal (6011) on a card used only for groceries, flagging potential fraud."
            },
            {
                question: "What does 'card-not-present' (CNP) fraud involve?",
                options: ["A) Using a stolen physical card", "B) Transactions without the physical card", "C) ATM withdrawals", "D) In-store purchases"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "CNP fraud occurs in transactions where the physical card isn’t used, typically online or over the phone, using stolen card details. It’s detected by patterns like velocity or mismatched addresses, unlike physical card use in ATMs or stores."
            },
            {
                question: "How can you reduce false positives without missing real fraud?",
                options: ["A) Ignore low-value transactions", "B) Use behavioral profiles", "C) Disable monitoring", "D) Increase alert thresholds only"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "Using behavioral profiles (e.g., typical spending patterns) reduces false positives by adding context, like not flagging a known traveler’s purchase. Ignoring transactions or disabling monitoring risks missing fraud, and raising thresholds alone may overlook subtle patterns."
            },
            {
                question: "Which tool is used to pull raw transaction data?",
                options: ["A) Excel", "B) SQL", "C) PowerPoint", "D) Word"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "SQL is used to query databases and pull raw transaction data, such as filtering transactions over ₹50,000. Excel is for analysis, not data extraction, while PowerPoint and Word are irrelevant for this task."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the goal for Time-to-First-Review (TTFR) for high-risk alerts?",
                options: ["A) < 5 minutes", "B) < 10 minutes", "C) < 30 minutes", "D) < 1 hour"],
                answer: "A",
                explanation: "The goal for TTFR for high-risk alerts is under 5 minutes to ensure rapid response to potential fraud. Longer times (10 minutes or more) risk delays in addressing critical issues."
            },
            {
                question: "What does a high false-positive rate indicate?",
                options: ["A) Efficient system", "B) Annoyed customers", "C) Low fraud detection", "D) High compliance"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "A high false-positive rate means many legitimate transactions are flagged, frustrating customers and wasting analyst time. It doesn’t indicate efficiency, low detection, or compliance, but rather a need for rule tuning."
            },
            {
                question: "What is a risk score based on?",
                options: ["A) Transaction amount only", "B) Multiple weighted factors", "C) Customer age", "D) Merchant name"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "A risk score (0–100) is calculated from weighted factors like amount, velocity, location, and device risk. It’s not based solely on amount, age, or merchant name, ensuring a comprehensive fraud assessment."
            },
            {
                question: "Which team collaborates on rule changes?",
                options: ["A) Marketing", "B) Risk", "C) HR", "D) Sales"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "The Risk team collaborates with analysts to update monitoring rules, especially for new patterns like money laundering. Marketing, HR, and Sales are not involved in fraud detection rule changes."
            },
            {
                question: "What is FATF?",
                options: ["A) Financial Action Task Force", "B) Fraud Analysis Task Force", "C) Financial Audit Team", "D) Federal Anti-Fraud Team"],
                answer: "A",
                explanation: "The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is a global body setting anti-money-laundering standards. Compliance with FATF ensures detection of suspicious flows, avoiding fines and reputational damage, unlike other listed teams."
            },
            {
                question: "How do you document a fraud case?",
                options: ["A) In a spreadsheet", "B) In a case-management tool", "C) Via email", "D) On paper"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "Fraud cases are documented in a case-management tool with details like transaction ID, investigation steps, and evidence. Spreadsheets, emails, or paper are less secure and not standard for this purpose."
            },
            {
                question: "What does a Merchant Category Code (MCC) like 5411 represent?",
                options: ["A) ATM Withdrawals", "B) Grocery Stores", "C) Airlines", "D) Hotels"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "MCC 5411 represents grocery stores. ATM withdrawals are 6011, airlines are 3000–3299, and hotels are 3501–3999. MCCs help analysts identify unusual transaction patterns."
            },
            {
                question: "What is a common sign of CNP fraud?",
                options: ["A) In-store purchase", "B) Mismatched shipping/billing addresses", "C) Physical card use", "D) Low transaction amounts"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "CNP fraud often involves mismatched shipping and billing addresses, indicating stolen card details used online. In-store purchases and physical card use are not CNP, and low amounts are less specific."
            },
            {
                question: "How do you spot a surge in fraud using Excel?",
                options: ["A) Create a pivot table", "B) Write a macro", "C) Use conditional formatting", "D) All of the above"],
                answer: "D",
                explanation: "In Excel, a pivot table analyzes MCC alert counts, conditional formatting highlights spikes, and macros automate data merging. All these techniques help identify fraud surges efficiently."
            },
            {
                question: "What does a risk score of 90/100 indicate?",
                options: ["A) Low priority", "B) Immediate review", "C) Legitimate transaction", "D) No action needed"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "A risk score of 90/100 indicates high fraud likelihood, requiring immediate review. Scores below 80 may be lower priority, and high scores don’t confirm legitimacy or inaction."
            },
            {
                question: "What is a source for staying updated on fraud methods?",
                options: ["A) FS-ISAC bulletins", "B) Marketing reports", "C) Customer feedback", "D) Sales data"],
                answer: "A",
                explanation: "FS-ISAC bulletins provide industry-shared insights on new fraud patterns. Marketing reports, customer feedback, and sales data are not primary sources for fraud method updates."
            },
            {
                question: "What is friendly fraud?",
                options: ["A) Fraud by employees", "B) Cardholder disputes legitimate purchases", "C) Online scams", "D) ATM skimming"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "Friendly fraud occurs when cardholders dispute valid purchases to get refunds, detected by dispute history or device consistency. It differs from employee fraud, online scams, or ATM skimming."
            },
            {
                question: "What tool is used for weekly fraud-monitoring reports?",
                options: ["A) Excel", "B) Tableau", "C) Word", "D) Notepad"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "Tableau or similar BI tools create visualizations for fraud-monitoring reports, showing metrics like alert trends and KPIs. Excel is for ad-hoc analysis, while Word and Notepad are unsuitable."
            },
            {
                question: "What ensures compliance with PCI-DSS?",
                options: ["A) Encryption", "B) Public data sharing", "C) No logging", "D) Open access"],
                answer: "A",
                explanation: "PCI-DSS requires encryption of card data in transit and at rest, along with access controls and logging. Public sharing, no logging, or open access violate security standards."
            },
            {
                question: "What is a process improvement example?",
                options: ["A) Ignore alerts", "B) Auto-batch low-value alerts", "C) Reduce staff", "D) Disable rules"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "Auto-batching low-value alerts for daily review frees analysts for high-risk cases, improving efficiency. Ignoring alerts, reducing staff, or disabling rules would compromise fraud detection."
            },
            {
                question: "How do you test a new fraud-detection rule?",
                options: ["A) Deploy immediately", "B) Back-test on historical data", "C) Ignore testing", "D) Ask customers"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "Back-testing a rule on historical data checks its effectiveness and false-positive rate. Immediate deployment, ignoring testing, or customer surveys risk system errors or inefficiencies."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the SLA for high-risk alerts acknowledgment?",
                options: ["A) < 5 minutes", "B) < 10 minutes", "C) < 30 minutes", "D) < 1 hour"],
                answer: "A",
                explanation: "High-risk alerts must be acknowledged within 5 minutes to meet SLAs, ensuring rapid fraud response. Longer times risk delays in addressing critical threats."
            },
            {
                question: "What do you do during a system outage?",
                options: ["A) Wait for recovery", "B) Use manual fallback", "C) Ignore alerts", "D) Reboot servers"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "During an outage, analysts switch to a manual fallback, like running SQL filters on raw feeds. Waiting, ignoring alerts, or rebooting servers (a Tech Ops task) are not appropriate."
            },
            {
                question: "How do you ensure data quality?",
                options: ["A) Nightly reconciliation", "B) Ignore errors", "C) Delete duplicates", "D) No checks"],
                answer: "A",
                explanation: "Nightly reconciliation compares transaction counts between systems to ensure data accuracy. Ignoring errors, deleting duplicates without checks, or no checks compromise data quality."
            },
            {
                question: "What protects customer confidentiality?",
                options: ["A) Public access", "B) Masked data", "C) No encryption", "D) Open sharing"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "Masking card numbers (e.g., showing last 4 digits) protects confidentiality, per PCI-DSS and GDPR. Public access, no encryption, or open sharing violate data privacy standards."
            },
            {
                question: "How do you onboard a new analyst?",
                options: ["A) Ignore training", "B) Provide shadowing", "C) Assign cases immediately", "D) No SOP review"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "Shadowing allows new analysts to learn workflows by observing live cases. Ignoring training, immediate case assignment, or skipping SOP review hinder effective onboarding."
            },
            {
                question: "What is an example of automating a task?",
                options: ["A) Manual data entry", "B) VBA macro for reports", "C) Handwritten notes", "D) No documentation"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "A VBA macro automating report generation (e.g., merging CSVs and emailing summaries) saves time. Manual entry, handwritten notes, or no documentation are inefficient."
            },
            {
                question: "How do you balance speed and accuracy?",
                options: ["A) Automate low-risk alerts", "B) Ignore SLAs", "C) Skip reviews", "D) Delay investigations"],
                answer: "A",
                explanation: "Automating low-risk alerts ensures speed, while manual reviews for high-risk alerts ensure accuracy. Ignoring SLAs, skipping reviews, or delaying investigations compromise both."
            },
            {
                question: "What is machine-learning-based fraud detection?",
                options: ["A) Fixed rules only", "B) Learning from past data", "C) Manual reviews", "D) No scoring"],
                answer: "B",
                explanation: "ML-based fraud detection learns from labeled data to identify subtle patterns, unlike fixed rules. It enhances scoring, unlike manual reviews or no-scoring approaches."
            },
